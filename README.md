Powerpoint and Excel files are supported (for now, more coming).

Advantages:

No more black box, interactively approve and edit each translated text  before making changes on your file.

No dumb file size or limits, unlike existing translation services.

Does not try to translate numbers or symbols, saving money.

Saves translations in a locally saved Dictionary, to avoid wasting money translating repeated texts across presentations.

The original and translated items are automatically saved on a separate .JSON in the same path as the original office file.

Original font and format is mostly preserved, if the translated text is longer than the original one, it will shrink the font size to make it fit.

The tables inside Power Point files are recognized.

Uses DeepL API or Google Translate website, the latter via Selenium Firefox. Nice to have if you run out of credit in DeepL.
